# Crypto-data-dashboard
# 📊 Crypto Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
Over the past week, I worked on a crypto dataset to practice data modeling, DAX measures, and storytelling with visuals in Power BI.
This project focuses on understanding price performance, returns, and risk metrics for different crypto assets.

# 🏦 Business Problem

Crypto markets are highly volatile, making it difficult for investors and analysts to:

Understand true performance of different assets over time.

Compare assets on a common scale.

Identify risk exposure through metrics like drawdowns and volatility.

Quickly switch between short-term vs. long-term perspectives for decision-making.

👉 This dashboard solves the problem by providing a clear, interactive, and metric-driven view of performance and risk, helping stakeholders make more informed investment decisions.

# 🔧 Steps Taken

**Data Cleaning** – Processed the raw dataset in Power Query.

**Date Table** – Built a proper Date table to enable time intelligence.

**DAX Measures** – Created financial measures including:

-Daily Returns

-7D / 30D Returns

-Drawdowns

-CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)

-Volatility

**Visual Design** – Built interactive visuals for:

-Price trends

-Short vs. long-term performance

-Risk and volatility analysis

# 💡 Key Insights

-Different assets behave very differently when indexed to 100.

-Easy comparison between short-term vs long-term returns with a slicer.

-Maximum drawdowns provided a clearer view of risk exposure across assets.

# Skills Applied


-Power BI → Power Query, DAX, Relationships, Time Intelligence.

-Data Modeling → Clean data + proper Date table.

-Financial Analytics → Returns, volatility, drawdowns.

-Data Storytelling → Turning complex data into clear insights.

# 🚀 How to Use
Download the .pbix file from this repo.
Open it in Power BI Desktop.
Connect to your own crypto dataset if you’d like to extend/customize the visuals.

# Data source
Data was taken from Kaggle.

# 📜Conclusion
This project was a reminder that great insights come from combining clean models, thoughtful measures, and clear visuals.
By applying financial metrics in Power BI, I was able to turn raw crypto data into meaningful stories about performance and risk.
